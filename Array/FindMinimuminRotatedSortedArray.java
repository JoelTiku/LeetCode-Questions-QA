Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. 
For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time 
results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.


Algorithm

Find the mid element of the array.

If mid element > first element of array this means that we need to look for the 
inflection point on the right of mid.

If mid element < first element of array this that we need to look for the 
inflection point on the left of mid.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 

In binary search we find out the mid point and decide to either search on the left or right 
depending on some condition.

Since the given array is sorted, we can make use of binary search. However, the array is rotated. 
So simply applying the binary search won't work here.

In this question we would essentially apply a modified version of binary search where the condition 
that decides the search direction would be different than in a standard binary search.
